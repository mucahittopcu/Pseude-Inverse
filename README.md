Pseudo Inverse Matrix
If the columns of a matrix A are linearly independent,
so  AT· A  is invertible and we obtain with the following formula the pseudo inverse:

A+ = (AT · A)-1 · AT
Here  A+  is a left inverse of  A , what means:  A+· A = E .

However, if the rows of the matrix are linearly independent, we obtain the pseudo inverse with the formula:

A+ = AT· (A · A T) -1
This is a right inverse of  A , what means:  A · A+ = E .

If both the columns and the rows of the matrix are linearly independent, 
then the matrix is invertible and the pseudo inverse is equal to the inverse of the matrix.
